          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage</li>
          <li>The head element is a container for metadata</li>
          <li>Meta elements contain information about the page that is used by the browser</li>
          <li>The user wont see information in the head or meta elements.</li>
          <li>Body element contains the content that is shown to the user. All the elements that we want the user to see and interact with must be placed inside this element.</li>
          <li>H1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6 elements represent the level of heading a given text block represents</li>
          <li>P element represents a paragraph or block of text</li>
          <li>Ul, ol, and li elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items</li>
          <li>Img element contains information about images that are displayed on the webpage, src attribute is the most important because it defines the location of the image</li>
          <li>`Alt` attribute contains a text string that describes the appearance and functionality of the image.</li>
          <li>Br element creates a line of empty space, or a line break, between two blocks of content</li>
          <li>A element (which stands for anchor) creates links to the same webpage or other webpages, href attribute points to the URL for the link</li>
          <li>Footer appears at the bottom of the page and usually contains the author, copyright, contact, sitemap, and navigation.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
     <ul>
       <li>Enter your CSS notes here</li>
       <li>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), to give the content style, programming language used by developers to define how webpage content is presented to users</li>
       <li>inline CSS- style an element directly in the HTML file, useful for quick and permanent changes but are less flexible than external and internal style sheets, because each inline style must be edited individually whenever you make a design change.</li>
       <li> internal style sheet- contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file.</li>
       <li>External style sheet: most common way to style a webpage, allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier.</li>
       <li>selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply</li>
       <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property. For EX, the declaration color: blue; includes the CSS property color and the value for that property, blue.</li>
       <li>margin property: indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element</li>
       <li> *- applies a rule to all the elements visible on the page EX: we have declared that ALL of the elements on the page will have the style properties margin and padding set as 0.  * {margin: 0; padding: 0;}</li>
       <li>< img> selector assigns property values to any image element in the markup. </li>
       <li>display property is assigned with the block value, which assigns each image to start on a new line.</li>
       <li><link> element: creates the connection to the external file. when we create an external CSS file, we need to link it to the HTML file. We store metadata, which contains information about the webpage. This is where we will add the link to our style sheet</li>
       <li>rel attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document resource.</li>
       <li>href attribute specifies the location (URL) of the external resource. </li>
       <li>box-shadow CSS property adds shadow effects around an element's frame. You can set multiple effects separated by commas. A box shadow is described by X and Y offsets relative to the element, blur and spread radius, and color. In our example, the X offset is 5px and defines the width or extent of the shadow on the X axis (or to the right of the box); the Y offset is 10px and defines the extent on the Y axis (or just below the box). We haven’t defined the blur or spread radius here, but you’ll learn more about this in time. We’ve used an HTML hexadecimal code to define the color.</li>
       <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
  <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>

      <h2>JavaScript</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Enter your JavaScript notes here</li>
        <li>a high-level dynamic programming language that allows users to interact with websites</li>
        <li>variable is simply a named container that allows us to store data in our code. declare a variable, we use the var keyword</li>
        <li>assignment operator = to assign the specific data that we want stored in our variable.</li>
        <li>All strings are surrounded by quotation marks. Note that each line of JavaScript code ends with a semicolon.</li>
        <li>the console.log method to output a message to the web console by adding an argument. In this case, console.log will output the value of topics to the web console because we've added it as an argument inside the parentheses.</li>
        <li>console.log method was created to make it easier for developers to test their code. Developers use it daily to debug and test the code that they write. Soon, using it will become second nature for you too!
          script.js file is linked within the <body> element.
          </li>
          <li>Chrome DevTools to View console.log Output: open Chrome DevTools using keyboard commands. If you’re using macOS, you can press Command+Option+I</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script. In JavaScript, code runs from the first statement at the top of the page, down to the last statement at the bottom of the page.</li>
          <li>An if statement is a way of introducing decision-making into our code. Just like its name sounds, when using the if statement, code will only execute if the statement meets a condition, or is true</li>
          <li>The strict equality operator (===) checks to see if two values are equal and types are equal, and returns a Boolean result true if the values are equal and false if the values are not equal.</li>
          <li>array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related in some way.</li>
          <li>the first item in any array has an index of 0, not 1.</li>
          <li>Index: Using each piece of data's index, or location number, we can access individual data inside the array. EX: shapes[0]; In order to see this in action, we should log it in the console, using the following line of code: console.log(shapes[0]);</li>
          <li>A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over. With a for loop we can tell the computer to go through each of the shapes in our array and log them to the console until there are no shapes left.</li>
          <li>The array length is important because the for loop needs to know how many times the code will run until there are no items left in the array. We can find the length of an array by using a built-in property of an array, appropriately named length</li>
          <li>A for loop contains the following three important statements: The first statement determines the starting point for our loop. Since we want to start at the beginning of the array, we declare a variable x and give it a value of 0 (because the first index of an array is always 0),</li>
          <li>The code x++ is a shortcut way of writing x+1. every time the code loops, x will increase by 1</li>
          <li>Functions: a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task, functions do not automatically execute when the JavaScript file (in our case, script.js) is run. you must call a function by name in order to execute it</li>
          <li>A function's name is followed by parentheses ()</li>
          <li>we add curly brackets {} that contain the code for the task we want to perform.</li>
