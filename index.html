        <h2>CSS</h2>
     <ul>
       <li>Enter your CSS notes here</li>
       <li>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), to give the content style, programming language used by developers to define how webpage content is presented to users</li>
       <li>inline CSS- style an element directly in the HTML file, useful for quick and permanent changes but are less flexible than external and internal style sheets, because each inline style must be edited individually whenever you make a design change.</li>
       <li> internal style sheet- contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file.</li>
       <li>External style sheet: most common way to style a webpage, allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier.</li>
       <li>selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply</li>
       <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property. For EX, the declaration color: blue; includes the CSS property color and the value for that property, blue.</li>
       <li>margin property: indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element</li>
       <li> *- applies a rule to all the elements visible on the page EX: we have declared that ALL of the elements on the page will have the style properties margin and padding set as 0.  * {margin: 0; padding: 0;}</li>
       <li><img> selector assigns property values to any image element in the markup. </li>
       <li>display property is assigned with the block value, which assigns each image to start on a new line.</li>
       <li><link> element: creates the connection to the external file. when we create an external CSS file, we need to link it to the HTML file. We store metadata, which contains information about the webpage. This is where we will add the link to our style sheet</li>
       <li>rel attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document resource.</li>
       <li>href attribute specifies the location (URL) of the external resource. </li>
       <li>box-shadow CSS property adds shadow effects around an element's frame. You can set multiple effects separated by commas. A box shadow is described by X and Y offsets relative to the element, blur and spread radius, and color. In our example, the X offset is 5px and defines the width or extent of the shadow on the X axis (or to the right of the box); the Y offset is 10px and defines the extent on the Y axis (or just below the box). We haven’t defined the blur or spread radius here, but you’ll learn more about this in time. We’ve used an HTML hexadecimal code to define the color.</li>
       <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
  <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
