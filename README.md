# <Prework Study Guide>

## Description

This study was created to help students study HTML, CSS and Javascript in order to succeed in the bootcamp. Aside from learning HTML, CSS and Javascript while creating this project I mostly learned the importance of debugging, being patient as a coder, researching on google, stackflow and reaching out to tutroing when you;ve spent hours stuck on an error and have no other option.

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?



If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

## Usage

This Prework Study Guide was designed to be straighfoward and organized in sections and bullet points. Each section (HMTL, CSS, JAVASCRIPT) contain definintions and step by step instructions on how to excute certain codes. If we open the DevTools console, we can see the JavaScript running. It will list the topics we learned from prework and choose one topic for us to study first
